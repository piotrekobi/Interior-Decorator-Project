## General info

The system is supposed to function under the following circumstances:

It is given 

* representing a wall fragment polygon (e.g. a wall without an opening door),
* a set of rectangles that represent photographs.

The system's task is to arrange the rectangles inside the polygon in an optimal way, taking into account the set limitations.

Additional requirements:

* the user draws a closed shape inside the polygon, in which rectangles should be placed in the first order,
* the user specifies the preferred distance between adjacent rectangles
* the user might determine the position himself (using the mouse) of selected rectangles.

## Technologies

* Python 3.9

  * Django 3.2.9

  * Whitenoise 5.3.0

* CSS

* JavaScript

  * InteractJS 1.10.11

* Azure App Service
* Azure Container Registry

## Setup

To run this project, you have to install Docker on your own (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Firstly build an image from a Dockerfile:

```shell
docker build . -t docker-interiors:latest
```

Nextly run your docker:

```shell
docker run docker-interiors:latest
```

The app will be available on the port 80 on your server.

<b>NOTE:</b> Please make sure that the port 80 is opened on your server.

Optionally, push the image to a remote container registry:

```Shell
docker login <registry-name> --username <your-login> --password <your-password>
docker push docker-interiors:latest
```

Using a container registry, you may configure a continuous deployment, e.g. on Azure App Service (you have to install Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest) and configure Azure App Service on your own (https://docs.microsoft.com/pl-pl/azure/app-service/tutorial-custom-container?pivots=container-linux)):

```Shell
az login
az webapp config container set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --docker-custom-image-name <registry-name>:latest --docker-registry-server-url https://<registry-name>
```
